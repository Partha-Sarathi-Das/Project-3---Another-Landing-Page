ðŸš€ Today, I built a simple webpage layout using HTML and CSS. Hereâ€™s what I used:

HTML:

Basic structure with div, h1, h3, img, and button tags.
Navigation bar with "Menu", "Log In", and "Sign Up" buttons.
Hero section with images and a main heading.
Footer with social media icons using remixicon.

CSS:

Flexbox for layout: #nav uses display: flex to space out items.
Styled buttons: .btn1 (white background) and .btn2 (red background).
Absolute positioning for images and text in the hero section.
Rotated images for a dynamic look.
Check out the code and let me know what you think! ðŸ’»âœ¨
